###Key Insights
Top Region: The East region generates the highest sales, contributing 33% (522K) to the total sales. This region should be prioritized for future marketing and sales efforts.
Payment Mode: A significant portion of sales (43%) comes through online payments, indicating the importance of digital payment methods. Offering more incentives for online payments may increase conversion rates.
High-Performing Segments: The consumer segment leads with 48% (753K) of total sales. Focused promotions in this segment can boost revenue further.
Top Categories: Phones (200K) and Chairs (180K) are the best-selling sub-categories. These products can be prioritized in inventory management and marketing campaigns.
Monthly Trends: Sales and profits show a sharp increase during the latter months, particularly in November and December, indicating the influence of holiday shopping seasons. Companies should launch targeted promotions during these months to capitalize on higher demand.
